 This repository contains the nine projects for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree (known as Business Analyst Nanodegree back in 2018).

**Part 1: Problem Solving with Analytics**

 Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression. Using Alteryx.

 Project 1: Predicting Diamond Prices

 Project 2: Predicting Catalog Demand

**Part 2: Data Wrangling** Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

 Project 3: Create an Analytical Dataset

 Project 4: Create Reports from a Database

**Part 3: Data Visualization** Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed. Using Tableau.

 Project 5: Visualize Movie Data

**Part 4: Classification Models** Use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

 Project 6: Predicting Default Risk

**Part 5: A/B Testing** Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

 Project 7: A/B Test a New Menu Launch

**Part 6: Time Series Forecasting** Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

 Project 8: Forecast Video Game Demand

**Part 7: Segmentation and Clustering** Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.

 Project 9: Capstone Project

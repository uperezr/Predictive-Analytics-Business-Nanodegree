## Project 5. Visualize Movie Data

You are a business analyst consultant and your client is a new movie production company looking to make a new movie. The client wants to make sure it’s successful to help make a name for the new company. They are relying on you to help understand movie trends to help inform their decision making. They’ve given you guidance to look into three specific areas:

- **Question 1:** How have movie genres changed over time?
- **Question 2:** How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?
- **Question 3:** How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based on novels?

On top of that, the client asked you to explore one other question that you find interesting based on the data provided.
